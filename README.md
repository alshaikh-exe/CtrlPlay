## Developer’s Note 🖋️
CtrlPlay was my way of merging e-commerce functionality with a gaming-inspired aesthetic. It challenged me to balance backend logic with frontend creativity: from secure authentication & CRUD operations to retro-styled design and responsive layouts.

I see CtrlPlay not just as a portfolio project but as a foundation that could evolve into a community-driven indie game marketplace.
